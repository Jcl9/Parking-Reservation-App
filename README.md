[![HitCount](http://hits.dwyl.com/Jcl9/Parking-Reservation-App.svg)](http://hits.dwyl.com/Jcl9/Parking-Reservation-App)

1. User registration – User inputs necessary information.
  
2. Parking reservation – User selects the event and the day (only days with events are open for reservation) and the garage. For example, user cannot reserve a space on a day when there is no event scheduled. Your application will show all garages with available spaces (do not show garages that are already full) and the price for the garage at different levels. When the user submits the request, a transaction must be created with information including garage, level, date, a tracking or confirmation number, and fee charged. Your application does not need to handle any money transactions. Your application will update the garage availability accordingly.
  
3. Parking cancellation – If the cancelation is requested at least 2 days before the event, you will mark the reservation ‘cancelled’ and ‘refunded’. You will update the garage availability accordingly. If the cancellation is requested too late, you will do the same except that no refund will be generated.
  
4. Event creation - The venue administrator can enter new events (at which venue) and their dates and pricing for each garage at different levels. He/she can also change the information such as parking fees , available spaces (for VIPs), event days (for example, a show on a certain day is rescheduled). He/she can remove an event or a date.
